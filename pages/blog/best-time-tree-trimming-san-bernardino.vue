            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Timing Matters</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Trimming trees at the right time promotes healthy growth,
                prevents diseases, and enhances the overall appearance of your
                landscape. Improper timing can stress the trees, making them
                more susceptible to pests and diseases.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Factors to Consider</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>
                    Tree Species: Different species have unique growth patterns
                    and needs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Climate: San Bernardino's climate, with its hot summers and
                    mild winters, influences the optimal trimming times.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tree Health: The current health and condition of the tree
                    can affect the best time for trimming.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">
                Optimal Trimming Times for Common Trees in San Bernardino
            </h2>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Deciduous Trees</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                Deciduous trees, which shed their leaves annually, benefit most
                from trimming during late winter to early spring.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>Best Time: Late January to early March</li>
                <li>
                    Reason: Trees are dormant, making it easier to see the
                    structure and remove dead or diseased branches without
                    stressing the tree.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Evergreen Trees</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                Evergreen trees, which retain their foliage year-round, can be
                trimmed in late winter or early spring before new growth starts.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>Best Time: February to early April</li>
                <li>
                    Reason: Trimming before the growth period ensures minimal
                    impact on the tree's development and health.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Fruit Trees</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                Fruit trees require precise trimming to maximize fruit
                production and tree health.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>
                    Best Time: Late winter to early spring (January to March)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reason: Dormant trimming promotes better fruit production
                    and reduces the risk of disease.
                </li>

                Seasonal Trimming Considerations
            </h2>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Winter Trimming</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                Winter is generally a good time for most tree trimming
                activities in San Bernardino.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>
                    Advantages: Trees are dormant, reducing the risk of disease
                    transmission and allowing for better visibility of the
                    treeâ€™s structure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Considerations: Avoid trimming during extremely cold snaps
                    to prevent damage.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Spring Trimming</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                Spring trimming can be beneficial for certain tree species.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>
                    Advantages: Encourages robust new growth and can help shape
                    the tree for the growing season.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Considerations: Be mindful of nesting birds and avoid
                    disturbing wildlife.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Summer Trimming</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                Summer trimming should be approached with caution.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>
                    Advantages: Useful for removing dead or hazardous branches.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Considerations: Excessive trimming can stress trees during
                    the hot summer months, making them vulnerable to pests and
                    diseases.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Fall Trimming</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                Fall trimming is not generally recommended.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>
                    Disadvantages: Can stimulate new growth that won't harden
                    before winter, leading to potential damage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Exceptions: Light trimming to remove dead or broken branches
                    can be done if necessary.
                </li>
