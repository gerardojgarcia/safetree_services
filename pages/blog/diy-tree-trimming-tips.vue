            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Preparing for Tree Trimming</h2>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Gather the Right Tools</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>Pruning Shears: Ideal for small branches and twigs.</li>
                <li>
                    Loppers: Suitable for thicker branches up to 2 inches in
                    diameter.
                </li>
                <li>Pruning Saw: Necessary for larger branches.</li>
                <li>
                    Safety Gear: Gloves, safety glasses, and a hard hat for
                    protection.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Understand the Basics</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>
                    Branch Collar: The swollen area where a branch meets the
                    trunk. Always cut just outside the branch collar to promote
                    proper healing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tree Structure: Identify the main branches and avoid
                    excessive trimming, which can stress the tree.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Safety First</h2>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Assess the Situation</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>
                    Check for Power Lines: Never trim branches near power lines;
                    call a professional for these tasks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Look for Weak Branches: Identify any dead or weak branches
                    that may fall during trimming.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Use Proper Techniques</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                Using the right techniques will ensure a clean cut and promote
                tree health.

                    Three-Cut Method for Large Branches:
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6">
                        <li>
                            Under Cut: Make a small cut on the underside of the
                            branch about 6-12 inches from the trunk to prevent
                            bark tearing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Top Cut: Make a second cut on the top of the branch,
                            a few inches beyond the first cut, to remove the
                            weight of the branch.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Final Cut: Cut just outside the branch collar to
                            remove the remaining stub.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>
                    Gloves and Safety Glasses: Protect your hands and eyes from
                    debris.
                </li>
                <li>Hard Hat: Protect your head from falling branches.</li>
                <li>
                    Stable Ladder: Use a stable ladder and have someone hold it
                    for added safety.

                <li>
                    Best Time: Late winter to early spring when trees are
                    dormant.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tips: Focus on removing dead, diseased, or crossing branches
                    to improve air circulation and sunlight penetration.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Tips: Trim only to shape the tree and remove dead or damaged
                    branches. Avoid excessive trimming, which can harm the tree.

                <li>
                    Tips: Prune to shape the tree and encourage fruit
                    production. Remove any branches growing towards the center
                    to allow sunlight to reach all parts of the tree.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>
                    Over-Trimming: Removing too many branches can stress the
                    tree and inhibit growth. Aim to remove no more than 25% of
                    the tree's canopy in one season.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Incorrect Cutting: Avoid leaving stubs or cutting too close
                    to the trunk. Both can lead to poor healing and increase the
                    risk of disease.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ignoring Safety: Never ignore safety precautions. Always
                    wear protective gear and be mindful of your surroundings.
