      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Understanding the Basics of Tree Pruning</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Pruning is more than just cutting branches—it's a strategic approach to shaping a tree's growth and health. There are several reasons to prune, including:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Enhancing Tree Structure:</strong> Regular pruning encourages a strong, balanced structure, which is crucial for a tree's stability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improving Sunlight Exposure:</strong> Removing excess branches allows more sunlight to penetrate the canopy, benefiting the entire tree.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Disease Prevention:</strong> Pruning diseased or dead branches helps prevent the spread of infections and promotes new, healthy growth.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Types of Pruning Techniques</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Different situations call for different pruning methods. Here are some key techniques to consider:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Thinning:</strong> This involves selectively removing branches to reduce density, allowing more light and air to circulate through the tree. This technique is particularly useful for trees in San Bernardino's sunny climate, where adequate airflow is essential.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Crown Reduction:</strong> Ideal for managing the size of a tree, crown reduction involves cutting back the height or spread of a tree. It's a preferred method for trees that have outgrown their space or pose a risk of damage during storms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Deadwooding:</strong> Focuses on removing dead, diseased, or dying branches. This not only improves the tree's appearance but also reduces the risk of branches falling and causing damage.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Pruning in San Bernardino: Timing is Everything</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        In San Bernardino, where the climate can be both hot and dry, timing your pruning efforts is critical.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Winter Pruning:</strong> Dormant pruning during the winter months is ideal for most tree species. It minimizes stress and encourages vigorous spring growth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Summer Pruning:</strong> Light pruning in the summer can help control growth and remove weak or unwanted branches, especially after the blooming season.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4"> Effective Pruning in Action</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Consider a local San Bernardino homeowner who regularly prunes their citrus trees. By using thinning techniques, they not only improve sunlight exposure but also enhance fruit production. This strategic approach has led to healthier trees with a more abundant harvest, showcasing the benefits of proper pruning practices.
