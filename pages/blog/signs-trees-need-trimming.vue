                Key Signs Your Trees Need Trimming
            </h2>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Overgrown Branches</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                One of the most obvious signs that your trees need trimming is
                the presence of overgrown branches. These branches can:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>
                    Obstruct Views and Pathways: Overgrown branches can block
                    windows, driveways, and sidewalks, making navigation
                    difficult and reducing visibility.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Interfere with Power Lines: Branches growing too close to
                    power lines pose a significant safety hazard and can cause
                    power outages.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Dead or Diseased Branches</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                Dead or diseased branches are not only unsightly but also
                dangerous. They can:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>
                    Fall Unexpectedly: Dead branches are prone to breaking and
                    falling, posing a risk to people and property below.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spread Disease: Diseased branches can spread infections to
                    the rest of the tree and neighboring plants if not promptly
                    removed.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Unbalanced Tree Structure</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                An uneven or unbalanced tree structure can indicate the need for
                trimming. This can be identified by:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>
                    Leaning Trees: Trees that lean significantly to one side may
                    have uneven growth, which can lead to instability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heavy Limbs: Large, heavy limbs can create stress on the
                    tree, increasing the risk of breakage.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Excessive Canopy Density</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                A dense canopy can prevent sunlight and air from reaching the
                inner branches and the ground below, leading to:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>
                    Reduced Air Circulation: Poor air circulation can create a
                    damp environment, promoting the growth of mold and mildew.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Limited Sunlight: Limited sunlight can affect the health of
                    the tree and the plants growing beneath it.

                    In Highland, the Johnson family noticed their backyard tree
